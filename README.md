# DTMF-in-Matlab

The project objective was to develop MATLAB code that facilitates user 
interaction with PC actions using audio signals generated by a smartphone's numerical keypad. This involved capturing audio input from the smartphone's microphone, processing it to filter out noise, and analysing the signal to decode the DTMF frequency pairs corresponding to pressed buttons. The 
decoded digits or symbols were utilized to trigger various actions on the PC.

Additionally, the software features a graphical user interface (GUI) allowing the user to start and stop the MATLAB script. The GUI displays real-time visualizations including:

- Time and frequency characteristics of the input signal,
- Time and frequency characteristics of the filtered signal,
- Output signal representing the decoded DTMF symbols.

The additional goal of the project wass to utilize these decoded DTMF symbols to control a snake video game, providing an interactive and engaging experience for the user.
